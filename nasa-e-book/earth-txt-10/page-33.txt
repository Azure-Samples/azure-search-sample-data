Tracing the Coast	China
The ocean does not heat up as much throughout a day as landmasses do. For this reason, cool, moist marine air commonly gives rise to dense clouds over the ocean. 
In this example from the coast of China, an onshore wind carries the clouds from the ocean toward the land. But the land is warmer, drier, and unfavorable for cloud growth. As a result, the marine clouds that move onshore tend to evaporate, leaving a cloud layer that traces the coastline.
