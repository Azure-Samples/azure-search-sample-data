Curving Cloud Streets	Brazil and Bolivia  
To the human eye, the wind is invisible. It can only be visualized by proxy, by its expressions in other phenomena like blowing leaves, airborne dust, white-capped waters—or the patterns of clouds.
Acquired in June 2014 by the Aqua satellite, this image shows a broad swath of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil and Bolivia as it appeared in the early afternoon. As sunlight warms the forest in the morning, water vapor rises on columns of heated air. When that humid air runs into a cooler, more stable air mass above, it condenses into fluffy cumulus clouds. 
Cumulus cloud streets often trace the direction, and sometimes the intensity, of winds—lining up parallel to the direction of the wind. Usually this means a straight line, but clouds can also line up along the concentric, curved lines of high-pressure weather systems, as they did here.
